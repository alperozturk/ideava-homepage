            <p>Google just got served again. On February 12, 2026, the European Commission opened a fresh antitrust investigation into Alphabet's crown jewel: the search ads auction system that generated over $175 billion in revenue last year. The allegation? Google has been "artificially increasing the clearing price" of ad auctions "to the detriment of advertisers."</p>

            <p>If you're running Google Ads campaigns for a startup or scale-up, this isn't just regulatory noise. It's confirmation of something many performance marketers have suspected for years: the game might be rigged.</p>

            <h2>What the EU Is Actually Investigating</h2>

            <p>According to a February 9 letter sent to potentially affected businesses, the European Commission suspects Google is manipulating how much advertisers pay in search ad auctions. Specifically, the regulator is looking at whether Google's auction mechanisms artificially inflate the "clearing price," which is the final amount winners pay per click.</p>

            <p>This isn't the EU's first time at this rodeo. Google has already accumulated a staggering &euro;9.5 billion in EU antitrust fines across four previous cases:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>2017:</strong> &euro;2.42 billion for Google Shopping self-preferencing</li>
                <li><strong>2018:</strong> &euro;4.34 billion for Android operating system restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>2019:</strong> &euro;1.49 billion for online advertising restrictions (AdSense)</li>
                <li><strong>2025:</strong> &euro;2.95 billion for abusive practices in advertising technology</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The new probe adds to an escalating wave of regulatory action. In December 2025, the Commission also opened a formal investigation into Google's use of online content to train its AI models. Brussels is clearly not done with Alphabet.</p>

            <h2>How Google's Ad Auction Actually Works (And Where the Problems Are)</h2>

            <p>To understand the gravity of this investigation, you need to understand how Google's search ad auction operates, and how it differs from what most marketers assume.</p>

            <h3>The Official Story</h3>

            <p>Google tells advertisers that its auction uses a "second-price" model. In theory, the winning bidder pays just one cent more than the second-highest bid. This is supposed to encourage honest bidding, since you never pay your maximum bid, only what's needed to beat the competition.</p>

            <h3>The Reality</h3>

            <p>Evidence from the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust trial and now the EU investigation paints a very different picture. Google has reportedly deployed several mechanisms that quietly inflate what advertisers pay:</p>

            <p><strong>Squashing:</strong> This technique increases the price paid by the highest bidder based on how far their predicted click-through rate (pCTR) diverges from competitors. In practice, it means the auction winner consistently pays more than a true second-price auction would require.</p>

            <p><strong>Randomized Generalized Second-Price (RGSP):</strong> Google introduced randomization into auction outcomes, making cost prediction harder for advertisers. Internal documents describe RGSP as "the best knob to raise prices in small increments over time." The result? An estimated 10% revenue increase for Google, funded entirely by higher advertiser costs.</p>

            <p><strong>Format Pricing:</strong> Internally described as "the best knob to engender large price increases," this mechanism adjusts prices based on ad format. It allows Google to raise costs without changing the fundamental auction dynamics that advertisers can observe.</p>

            <p><strong>Match-Type Expansions:</strong> Google automatically broadens keyword matching, creating "thicker auctions" with more competing bidders. More bidders means higher prices. Advertisers cannot opt out of these expansions, meaning they lose control over which searches trigger their ads.</p>

            <h3>The Transparency Problem</h3>

            <p>Making matters worse, Google has progressively limited search term report visibility. Advertisers can no longer see a significant percentage of the queries that trigger their ads. One industry analyst compared it to "buying a product without knowing what it is." You're paying more, but you have less information about what you're paying for.</p>

            <h2>The Advertiser Cost Framework: Understanding Your Real Exposure</h2>

            <p>I work with startups and scale-ups that spend anywhere from &euro;10,000 to &euro;500,000 monthly on Google Ads. When I audit their accounts, I consistently find that the "hidden inflation tax" from these auction mechanics represents 10-15% of total spend. For a company spending &euro;100,000 per month, that's &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 quietly disappearing.</p>

            <p>Here's a framework I use with clients to assess their exposure to auction price inflation. I call it the <strong>Ad Spend Integrity Audit</strong>:</p>

            <h3>Layer 1: Query Match Drift</h3>
            <p>Compare the search terms actually triggering your ads against your keyword list. If more than 30% of your traffic comes from terms you didn't explicitly target, your spend is being inflated by match-type expansions. Download your search term report weekly and track the ratio of intended versus unintended queries over time.</p>

            <h3>Layer 2: CPC Trend Analysis</h3>
            <p>Track your average CPC on exact-match keywords month over month, controlling for Quality Score changes. If CPCs are rising 5-10% quarterly without competitive shifts in your industry, auction mechanics, not market dynamics, are likely the cause.</p>

            <h3>Layer 3: Auction Insights Benchmarking</h3>
            <p>Use Google's own Auction Insights report to compare your impression share and overlap rate against competitors. If your impression share is dropping while your bids stay the same, it may indicate that auction price floors are moving upward.</p>

            <h3>Layer 4: Cross-Channel Cost Comparison</h3>
            <p>Run identical campaigns on Microsoft Ads (Bing) and compare the cost per acquisition. In my experience, Bing typically delivers 20-40% lower CPAs for the same keywords. This gap has widened over the past two years, which aligns with the timeline of Google's alleged price manipulation.</p>

            <h2>What This Means for Marketers Right Now</h2>

            <p>Regulatory investigations move slowly. The EU probe could take years to reach a conclusion, and any fines, potentially up to 10% of Google's global annual revenue, won't directly refund your inflated ad spend. But the investigation validates a strategic shift that smart marketers should already be making.</p>

            <h3>1. Diversify Your Paid Search Mix</h3>

            <p>If more than 70% of your paid search budget goes to Google, you're overexposed. Microsoft Ads reaches 38% of the U.S. desktop search market through Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. For B2B companies especially, Bing's audience skews toward decision-makers in corporate environments where Edge is the default browser.</p>

            <p>I recently helped a B2B SaaS client shift 25% of their Google Ads budget to Microsoft Ads. Within 60 days, their blended cost per qualified lead dropped 18%, with Bing delivering leads at 35% lower cost than Google for the same keyword set.</p>

            <h3>2. Tighten Your Keyword Strategy</h3>

            <p>Google's match-type expansions are working against you. Fight back by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using exact match as your primary match type for high-intent keywords</li>
                <li>Building aggressive negative keyword lists (aim for 500+ negatives per campaign)</li>
                <li>Reviewing search term reports weekly, not monthly</li>
                <li>Setting up automated scripts to flag when matched search terms drift more than 20% from your target keywords</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Invest in Owned Channels</h3>

            <p>Every euro you spend on SEO, email marketing, and content compounds over time. Every euro you spend on Google Ads evaporates the moment you stop paying. Companies that have built strong organic search presence are insulated from auction price inflation. Those that haven't are increasingly at Google's mercy.</p>

            <p>The most resilient marketing strategies I see at high-growth companies follow a 40/30/30 model: 40% of budget toward owned channels (SEO, content, email), 30% toward Google Ads, and 30% toward diversified paid channels (Microsoft Ads, LinkedIn, programmatic).</p>

            <h3>4. Demand Better Measurement</h3>

            <p>If you can't see which queries trigger your ads, you can't optimize effectively. Use third-party tools like Adalysis, Optmyzr, or custom scripts to fill the visibility gaps that Google's reduced search term reporting creates. Build your own attribution models rather than relying solely on Google's self-reported conversion data.</p>

            <h2>The Bigger Picture: Why Regulatory Action Matters for Marketing Strategy</h2>

            <p>Some marketers dismiss antitrust investigations as background noise. That's a mistake. Here's why this probe matters strategically:</p>

            <p><strong>Structural remedies are on the table.</strong> The European Commission has already signaled that for previous ad tech violations, only structural remedies, specifically the divestiture of certain Google services, would effectively resolve the underlying conflicts of interest. If the EU forces Google to structurally separate its ad auction from its search engine, the entire paid search landscape changes.</p>

            <p><strong>The U.S. is moving in parallel.</strong> The Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google produced internal documents showing deliberate price manipulation. A U.S. court has already found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly in search. The convergence of U.S. and EU regulatory action makes structural changes more likely, not less.</p>

            <p><strong>The Digital Markets Act adds teeth.</strong> Under the EU's DMA, Google is designated a "gatekeeper." Non-compliance with DMA obligations can result in fines up to 10% of global annual turnover, with repeat offenses pushing that to 20%. The regulatory environment has fundamentally shifted from slap-on-the-wrist fines to existential threats.</p>

            <h2>A Contrarian Take: This Could Actually Be Good for Performance Marketing</h2>

            <p>Here's what most coverage of this investigation misses: if the EU's probe leads to genuine transparency reforms in Google's auction system, performance marketers win.</p>

            <p>A fairer auction means your Quality Score and bid strategy matter more than Google's hidden "knobs and tunings." It means the advertisers with the best ads, landing pages, and targeting win, not just the ones willing to pay whatever Google's black box demands.</p>

            <p>For startups and scale-ups competing against deep-pocketed incumbents, a more transparent auction is an equalizer. When the house takes a smaller hidden cut, the skill gap between a sophisticated marketer and a lazy one widens. That's exactly the environment where companies with smart marketing leadership, even fractional or part-time, outperform those throwing money at the problem.</p>

            <h2>What to Do This Week</h2>

            <p>Don't wait for the EU to finish its investigation. Here are five actions you can take immediately:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Run the Ad Spend Integrity Audit</strong> described above. Document your baseline across all four layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Set up a Microsoft Ads pilot</strong> with 15-20% of your Google budget. Mirror your top-performing campaigns.</li>
                <li><strong>Review your match types.</strong> If you're still using broad match as your primary type, switch to exact and phrase match for your highest-spend keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Install search term monitoring scripts.</strong> Automate weekly alerts for query drift and CPC anomalies.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate your channel dependency ratio.</strong> If Google represents more than 50% of your customer acquisition, build a 90-day plan to diversify.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The EU investigation will play out over months or years. But the strategic lesson is available right now: any marketing strategy that depends heavily on a single platform, especially one facing credible allegations of price manipulation, is a strategy built on unstable ground.</p>

            <p>If you're navigating these shifts and need help auditing your paid search exposure or building a diversified acquisition strategy, that's exactly the kind of strategic challenge a fractional CMO engagement is designed for. No need to hire a full-time executive to solve a focused problem.</p>
